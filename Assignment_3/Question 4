Question:-

Create a function Employee, having id, name, basic_Salary as arguments.

Compute HRA, DA, TA, GS, NS.

HRA is 30% of Basic Salary.
DA is 10% of Basic Salary.
TA is 20% of Basic Salary.

GS = Basic Salary + HRA + DA + TA;

TAX DEDUCTION is 10% of GS.

NS = GS - TAX DEDUCTION.

NOte : Use Basic Salary in Lexical Scope 
Print salary slip of the employee.



Answer:-

function Employee(id, name, basic_Salary){

        function salary() {
        var hra = basic_Salary*0.3;
        var da = basic_Salary*0.1;
        var ta = basic_Salary*0.2;

        
        
        var gs = basic_Salary + hra + da + ta;
        
        
        var td = gs*0.1;

        var ns = gs-td;
        console.log(`Id :- ${id} Name :- ${name}  Net Salary:- ${ns}`);
    }
    return {salary};
}

Employee(1,"shivam", 10000).salary();
